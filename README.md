# 🐧 KNN Penguin Classifier

A custom K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning model built to classify penguin species based on flipper and bill length. This project focuses on learning core ML concepts by implementing KNN from scratch and comparing it to a library-based approach.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Manual KNN algorithm using Euclidean distance
- 📊 Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- 📈 Accuracy comparison with `scikit-learn`'s KNN implementation
- 🧠 Great for learning how classification algorithms work under the hood

## 📂 Dataset

This project uses the [Palmer Penguins dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/), a popular alternative to the Iris dataset. It includes measurements for Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap penguins.

## 📸 Sample Visuals

- Scatter plots showing flipper vs. bill length
- Decision boundary visualizations
- Species distribution charts

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn (used for benchmarking)
